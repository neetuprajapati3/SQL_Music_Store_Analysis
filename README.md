# Music Store Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a music store's database, aimed at uncovering valuable business insights. Using SQL, I tackled a range of queries, categorized by difficulty, to explore customer behavior, revenue trends, and the performance of various music genres and artists.

**Key Insights & Analysis**

1.Identified the senior-most employee and the best-performing customers and cities based on revenue.

2.Determined the top 3 invoice totals and analyzed the countries with the highest number of invoices.

3.Highlighted the most popular music genres by country and the best-selling artists, focusing on Rock music listeners.

4.Conducted advanced analysis to calculate the amount spent by customers on specific artists and identified the highest-spending customer in each country.

5.Analyzed song lengths to find tracks longer than the average and explored the most popular music genres globally.
Tools Used
**SQL**: For data exploration and query optimization.

**Database Tables**: Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Genre, Album, Artist.

This project demonstrates my ability to extract actionable insights, perform data aggregation, and solve real-world business problems using SQL.
